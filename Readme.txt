This is a toolkit of different functions, class modules, and other general useful snippets of code
that I've created overtime to use primarily in Excel, though other functions exist in othe langauges as well.

All the VBA functions are stored in the VBA folder. As you can surely tell, this is an ongoing work 
in progress. Toolkits that are ready to be dragged and dropped into your project all start with 
the "z_" convention. Other files are typically useful only for reference for certain VBA functions.

Note that I'm only a novice programmer in other languages, so while they may be useful for some purposes,
I'd stick with the VBA tools for now.  Code borrowed from other places on the web has been attributed
whenever possible.

Much of the files in the root directory are used for my programmer's notepad setup; ignore them.
